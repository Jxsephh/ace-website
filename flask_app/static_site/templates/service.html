            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From it's inception ACE has been committed to giving back to the local community. Over the years we have supported various charities in the 
            College Station / Bryan area including Camp Kessem, Bryan's food bank, and most recently Camp Hope.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Camp Hope is a foundation which helps connect 
            veterans who have seen combat to vital resources they need to deal with the transition back to civilian life. These resources include 
            peer support and mentoring for those sufferring from the effects of PTSD, interim housing, and above all a support group of peers and professionals 
            who understand the real impact combat can have on a person. If you would like to learn more about or get in contact with this excellent charity, 
            please visit <a href="http://ptsdusa.org/camp-hope/" target="_blank">PTSD USA's website</a>.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, ACE raised money for this deserving organization by hosting a BBQ cookout event which we hope to grow in the coming years.
